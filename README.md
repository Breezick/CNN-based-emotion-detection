# CNN-based-emotion-detection
This model uses Convolutional Neural Network to learn 8 different facial expression such as "neutral", "anger", "contempt", "disgust", "fear", "happy", "sadness" and "surprise". I can't upload the dataset as the authors do not authorize such, you can request the dataset here http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/.

This model was able to get an accuracy of 87%. I couldn't upload the jupyter notebook copy because of issues with my system. But you can download the dataset from the link given, use Palkab method as referenced below to sort the images in different folders and run this my model.

The dataset used is CK+ based on

– Kanade, T., Cohn, J. F., & Tian, Y. (2000). Comprehensive database for facial expression analysis. Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG’00), Grenoble, France, 46-53.

– Lucey, P., Cohn, J. F., Kanade, T., Saragih, J., Ambadar, Z., & Matthews, I. (2010). The Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+): A complete expression dataset for action unit and emotion-specified expression. Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on CVPR for Human Communicative Behavior Analysis (CVPR4HB 2010), San Francisco, USA, 94-101

The ideal of sorting the images into several folders was gotten from
